# **SC Security Workshop**

This chapter focuses on the securing smart contract and some of the best approaches when designing contracts.

Here's the structured plan for the workshop:

We introduce the BlankHub smart contract, which serves as a hub for integrating various functionalities from other smart contracts. The primary goal of BlankHub is to explore common security practices and vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

### Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Understand the staking mechanism and its applications.
- Have practical experience in developing securing contracts.

## **Deploy**

Deploy your BlankHub contract to Sepolia with following command:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-blank-hub.js --network sepolia
```
